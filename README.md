Hi, I’m @stephyriega, an Economics student at PUCP. Currently, I'm a Research Analyst in [Innovations for Poverty Actions](https://github.com/PovertyAction) and my hobbies are reading, swimming and trying new stuff. I’m interested in Applied Microeconomics and Data Sciense. You can reach me at @sriegae on Twitter or check out my [website](https://stephyriega.github.io/) .
